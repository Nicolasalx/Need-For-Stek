# Goal of the project

The Need4Stek project, an artificial intelligence project where the aim is to develop an AI capable of driving a car on a virtual circuit without hitting the walls or driving in the wrong direction.

The project uses several tools such as CoppeliaSim, a robot simulator, and an API called n4s to interact with the car and test the simulation.

The AI must be able to make real-time decisions based on data such as that provided by a LIDAR (which measures the distance to obstacles) and complete laps of the track quickly and efficiently.

The aim is to create an autonomous AI that can adapt to situations encountered on the circuit, including collision avoidance and optimal cornering.

I received a grade of B for this project, highlighting my ability to create a functional AI that meets the performance and safety criteria required for this challenge.
